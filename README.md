The HyperLogLog algorithm [1] is a space efficient method to estimate the 
cardinality of extraordinarily large data sets. This module is written in C
using a Murmur3 hash [2] for python 2.7.x or python 3.x.

v 1.2.7

Setup
=====

You will need the python development package. On Ubuntu, you can install this
package using:

    # python 2.7
    sudo apt-get install python-dev

or:

    # python 3
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev

Now install using pip:

    sudo pip install HLL

Alternatively, install using setup.py:

    sudo python setup.py install

Quick start
===========

    from HLL import HyperLogLog

    hll = HyperLogLog(5) # use 2^5 registers
    hll.add('some data')
    estimate = hll.cardinality()

Documentation
=============

    add(data)

Adds *data* to the estimator where data is a string, buffer, or bytes
type. Returns `True` if the registers were updated otherwise returns `False`.

    HyperLogLog(k, seed=314)

Create a new HyperLogLog using 2^*k* registers, *k* must be in the
range [2, 16]. Set *seed* to determine the seed value for the Murmur3
hash. The default value was chosen arbitrarily.

    merge(hll)

Merges another HyperLogLog into the current one. Merging compares individual
registers and takes the maximum value for each one. The registers of the other
HyperLogLog are unaffected.

    murmur3_hash(data, seed=314)

Gets a signed integer from a Murmur3 hash of *data* where *data* is a
string, buffer, or bytes (python 3.x). Set *seed* to determine the seed
value for the Murmur3 hash. The default value was chosen arbitrarily.

    registers()

Gets a bytearray of the registers.

    seed()

Gets the seed value used in the Murmur3 hash.

    set_register(index, value)

Sets the register at *index* to *value*. Indexing is zero-based.

    set_registers(registers)

Sets the registers to *registers*. Extra or missing registers in *registers* are
ignored. This method can be used to restore a HyperLogLog from a bytearray.

    size()

Gets the number of registers.
